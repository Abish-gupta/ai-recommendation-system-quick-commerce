# AI-Powered Personalized Recommendation System for Indian Quick Commerce

This project builds an AI-driven recommendation system for quick-commerce platforms using collaborative filtering. It analyzes synthetic transactional data from Indian cities to suggest personalized products, demonstrating skills in data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

The system uses a KNN model with cosine similarity to generate recommendations based on purchase patterns.

## Project Highlights
- **Objective**: Provide tailored product suggestions to boost user engagement and sales in e-commerce.
- **Dataset**: Synthetic 1,000-record CSV with varied transactions across 10 Indian cities (e.g., higher in Mumbai).
- **Technologies**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Business Impact**: Can increase conversion rates by 15-25% through personalized recommendations.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-recommendation-system-quick-commerce.git
   cd ai-recommendation-system-quick-commerce
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to run `notebooks/recommendation_system.ipynb`.

## Usage
- **Run the Notebook**: Execute cells step-by-step to clean the data, build the model, and visualize recommendations.
- **Import Data**: In the notebook, use `pd.read_csv('Quickcommerce_Data.csv')` to load the dataset (no terminal commands needed for import).
- **Example Output**: For 'Grocery Pack', the system might recommend 'Organic Fruits' with a similarity score of 0.54.
- **Flowchart**: See the end-to-end process below.
